When I'm not working in the lab, my office, or the field, I'm usually playing outside. I enjoy most nature-powered sports, like surfing, paddle-boarding, cycling, running, and hiking.

I ran some of my recent activity data (I wear a Garmin Vivoactive HR) through one of the same scripts I use to create interactive data maps and ended up with this, which shows my watersports in blue, hiking in orange, running in green, and cycling in magenta.

/*Maybe add some pictures here too? */
