Smartfin is a surfboard fin (more watercraft models to come) equipped with ocean sensors and a program designed to give environmental health advocates a way to contribute to cutting edge science just by doing what they love: surfing!

Here's a data visualization that I made to show off some of Smartfin's capabilities. One of the surfers in this video is equipped with a Smartfin and is collecting temperature, motion, and position data while surfing. If you watch closely, you can probably guess which one by seeing who is riding waves when the graph of speed shows large peaks!

I am designing new sensors and scientific applications for Smartfin. Please check out the project's official website at [smartfin.org](https://smartfin.org) for much more info.
