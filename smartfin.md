Smartfin is an Internet of Things surfboard fin equipped with oceanographic sensors and a program designed to give environmental health advocates a way to contribute to cutting edge science just by doing what they love: surfing!

Here's a data visualization that I made to show off some of Smartfin's capabilities. One of the surfers in this video is equipped with a Smartfin and is collecting temperature, motion, and position data while surfing. If you watch closely, you can probably guess which one by seeing who is riding waves when the graph of speed shows large peaks!

As Smartfin's head of R&D, I am designing new sensors and scientific applications for Smartfin and planning on integrating it with alternate "platforms of opportunity," such as kayaks, sailboats, scuba gear, etc. I am reinventing the Smartfin's core firmware and hardware in order to take advantage of ever-evolving wireless data transfer technologies. With global cellular connectivity, Smartfin will be able to transmit data to the cloud almost as soon as the surfer exits the water, enabling near-real-time coastal data analytics. I am also adapting/miniaturizing technology from the [WavepHOx](../sup-science) in order to enable biogeochemical research using Smartfins. 

Please check out the project's official website at [smartfin.org](https://smartfin.org) for much more info.
