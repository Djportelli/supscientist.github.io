I work and play where the ocean meets the land. I’m a coastal oceanographer, paddleboarder, surfer, rower, sailor, teacher, and learner. Humans have always thought of coasts as playgrounds but we’ve more recently recognized that we also treat them as dumping grounds for our trash, (micro-)plastics, (treated) sewage, and CO<sub>2</sub>, to name a few. I study coastal waters because I want to protect them. For myself and for you. And for many generations to come.

I’m a research and development engineer at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu) and the lead engineer for the [Smartfin Project](https://smartfin.org). I invent and apply novel marine chemical sensing techniques and analytical approaches in the (mostly coastal) ocean in order to investigate natural and anthropogenic phenomena. Please explore my various projects as a (paddleboarding) marine chemist @ Scripps Oceanography and an environmental scientist @ the San Francisco Estuary Institute (2015 – 16).
