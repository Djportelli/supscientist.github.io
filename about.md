I work and play where the ocean meets the land. I’m a coastal oceanographer, paddleboarder, surfer, rower, sailor, teacher, and learner. Humans have always thought of coasts as playgrounds but we’ve more recently recognized that we also treat them as dumping grounds for our trash, (micro-)plastics, (treated) sewage, and CO_2, to name a few. I study coastal waters because I want to protect them. For myself and for you. And for many generations to come.

I’m currently the lead engineer for the [Smartfin Project](https://smartfin.org). Smartfin is a surfboard fin (more watercraft models to come) equipped with ocean sensors and a program designed to give environmental health advocates a way to contribute to cutting edge science just by doing what they love. Please explore my various projects as a (paddleboarding) marine chemist @ Scripps Oceanography and an environmental scientist @ the San Francisco Estuary Institute (2015 – 16).
