### San Francisco Estuary Institute
I was an Environmental Scientist at the San Francisco Estuary Institute in 2015 –16, investigating the effects of nutrient pollution and potential eutrophication in San Francisco Bay. I used multiple analytical tools (mostly Python and R) and environmental sensors to quantify the Bay’s ever-changing biogeochemistry.

I really enjoy trying to visualize environmental datasets in new ways in order to extract additional meaning. Here’s an example of SFEI’s Lower South San Francisco Bay moored sensor data plotted on polar coordinates. Radius ~ pressure; theta ~ springiness (or daily range); color represents the high pass filtered dissolved oxygen, % of saturation.

Check out The Mooring Report, a monthly e-newsletter from SFEI (I’m the editor and a frequent contributor) which provides snapshots of San Francisco Bay’s ecosystem nutrition. Take a look at our latest edition here (http://www.sfei.org/tmr/2016-06) and scroll to the bottom of that page to sign up for future editions!

Please check back as I update this page with publications and interesting discoveries about estuarine biogeochemistry and how it affects you!
