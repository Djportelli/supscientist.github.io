Many people think that scientists are just geeks who like staring at beakers in the lab. We’re not. At least we’re not just that... We’re (grown-up?) kids who love exploring. We like surfing, rock climbing, hiking, biking, running, sailing, diving, paddling, and, most importantly, learning about the world around us.

SUP, Science is my way of reminding myself and others about our role in environmental health and environmental science. Here are a few professional videos and articles that capture the essence of SUP, Science.

SUP, Science is all about scientific adventures. We strap a chemical sensor known as the WavepHOx (because it measures pH and oxygen) to Stand Up Paddleboards (SUPs) and paddle through the surf zone. Paddleboards are ideal for near shore measurements because they are extremely mobile while barely disrupting the natural dynamics of the water—critical for accurate recordings of our environment. Equally importantly, SUPs are accessible by people of essentially all ages. This means that our scientific discoveries won’t be hidden in the lab; they’ll be on the water’s surface where all can see and even participate. Ocean chemistry is changing at a rate that hasn’t been “experienced” for over 20 million years. We have at our fingertips a unique opportunity to begin recording these changes in a tangible way.

I developed SUP, Science as a graduate student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. As an avid waterman, oceanographer, and engaged volunteer, I saw an immense opportunity to bring my interests together to match the world’s need for a better understanding of our role in global change.
