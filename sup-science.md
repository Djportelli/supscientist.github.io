Many people think that scientists are just geeks who like staring at beakers in the lab. We’re not. At least we’re not _just_ that... We’re (grown-up) kids who love exploring. We like surfing, rock climbing, hiking, biking, running, sailing, diving, paddling, and, most importantly, learning about the world around us.

SUP, Science is my way of reminding myself and others about our role in environmental health and environmental science. Here are a few professional videos and articles that capture the essence of SUP, Science.

Scripps Oceanography: Around the Pier (web article)

SUP, Science is all about scientific adventures. We strap a chemical sensor known as the WavepHOx (it measures pH and Oxygen) to Stand Up Paddleboards (SUPs) and paddle in and around the surf-zone. Paddleboards are ideal for near shore measurements because they are extremely mobile while barely disrupting the natural dynamics of the water and shallow ecosystems—-critical for accurate recordings of our environment. This means that our scientific discoveries won’t be hidden in the lab; they’ll be on the water’s surface where all can see and even participate.

I spearheaded SUP, Science as a graduate student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. As an avid waterman, oceanographer, and engaged volunteer, I saw an immense opportunity to bring my interests together while meeting the humanity's need for a better understanding of our role in global change.

SUP, Science is the result of generous support from Timothy Ray’s family and the Scripps Foundation for Science & the Environment. The WavepHOx was developed in Todd Martz‘s lab at Scripps Oceanography. Thank you!
